    <h1>BREAKING NEWS: Newham to Ban Cars, Cats & Cutlery</h1>
    <p><em>Foxes, Ladders, and Spoons Rise to Power<br>By East End Observer & Occasional Sausage Roll Reviewer, Stuart “Woke-but-Wary” Templeton</em></p>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>In a shocking yet delightfully smug turn of events, the Borough of Newham has passed a radical new motion in what local officials are calling “The Ultimate Green Pivot.” Cars, cats, and knives have all been entirely banned in a sweeping policy overhaul aimed at turning the East End into what one councillor described as “an edgy Swedish commune, but with more chicken shops.”</p>

    <h2>🚗 CAR-FREE NEWHAM INITIATIVE</h2>
    <p>The car ban came into effect at 5am this morning. Overnight, every motor vehicle was towed by a fleet of bicycles pulling reinforced eco-trailers (powered by oat milk).
    “It’s honestly a spiritual cleanse,” said Ash Wildroot, a 27-year-old barista/candlemaker from Forest Gate wearing a reclaimed parachute as a poncho. “Now I can skateboard to my foraging circles without inhaling diesel. I haven’t breathed this much air since I went to Brighton once.”</p>
    <p>LTNs (Low Traffic Neighbourhoods) will now be enforced with emotionally sensitive drones that gently discourage rule-breakers with stern haikus and biodegradable glitter bombs. “The LTNs will save all,” reads the new borough-wide mural painted entirely in chalk and hope.</p>

    <h2>🐱 TOTAL CAT BAN ANNOUNCED</h2>
    <p>In what animal rights groups are calling “purrposterous,” Newham has banned domestic cats, citing rising tensions between cats and foxes. “We’ve had too many garden turf wars,” said Chief Animal Mediator Fiona “Stingray” Baxter. “Cats simply don’t respect the bin boundaries.”</p>
    <p>A special Cat Amnesty Bin will be placed outside Stratford Centre. Owners are asked to deposit their feline “gently and with a short poem” by Thursday.</p>

    <h2>🦊 FOXES ARE THE NEW PETS</h2>
    <p>In a surprise twist, foxes have now been reclassified as companion animals. “They’re streetwise, low-maintenance, and understand council recycling policy better than most humans,” stated the official Borough Handbook, now available as a scented zine.</p>
    <p><strong>Instructions for Fox Taming, per the Borough:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Leave a trail of Richmond sausages to your back door.</li>
      <li>Offer a name. (Suggested: “Gary,” “Snuffles,” or “Michael Gove.”)</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to put a jumper on it. You will lose a toe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🔪 KNIFE BAN IN FOREST GATE, SPOONS TAKE OVER</h2>
    <p>In a bid to curb rising crime and poor cheese slicing etiquette, all knives have been banned from Forest Gate. In their place, the borough is encouraging residents to use “The Trusty Spoon.”</p>
    <p>A 14-day training program in spoon-carving, spoon-fencing, and spoon-chiselled salad prep will be held in Forest Gate Library’s rooftop garden (attendance mandatory unless already in a band).</p>
    <p>“Spoons are round, peaceful, and emotionally safe,” said Councillor Donna Pease-Breeze. “You’d be surprised what you can do with the right wrist action and enough passive aggression.”</p>

    <h2>🔥 CHAOS ON WANSTEAD FLATS</h2>
    <p>A bizarre scene unfolded last Saturday when a cat (ironically named “Freedom”) went missing during a rogue BBQ in Wanstead Flats. A fire engine was dispatched after reports of “a suspicious amount of vegan smoke.”</p>
    <p>Two men, known locally as “See You” and “Next Tuesday”, attempted to flee the scene on a stolen tandem bike, only to be stopped by The Hunter – a mysterious figure in a trench coat, wellies, and a compostable balaclava.</p>
    <p>The cat was recovered unharmed, although it reportedly hissed at the fire engine.</p>

    <h2>🪜 LADDERMANIA 2025 & THE F.G. DADS</h2>
    <p>In lighter news, Forest Gate’s “Dads With Ladders” Telegram group has gone viral after their Stairway to Heaven (But Practical) campaign inspired the borough’s new slogan:
    <strong>“LADDERS UP, NEWHAM!”</strong></p>
    <p>Special thanks to Colin T. for recommending the Werner Fibreglass 12-Step, and Steve B. for pointing out that “you should never trust a man with a rusted hinge.”</p>
    <p>A statue of a heroic dad holding a cordless drill and a ladder is being erected next to the Upton Park KFC.</p>
